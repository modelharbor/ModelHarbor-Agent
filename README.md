## Local Setup & Development

1. **Clone** the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```sh
pnpm install
```

3. **Run the extension**:

There are several ways to run the Roo Code extension:

### Development Mode (F5)

For active development, use VSCode's built-in debugging:

Press `F5` (or go to **Run** → **Start Debugging**) in VSCode. This will open a new VSCode window with the Roo Code extension running.

- Changes to the webview will appear immediately.
- Changes to the core extension will also hot reload automatically.

### Automated VSIX Installation

To build and install the extension as a VSIX package directly into VSCode:

```sh
pnpm install:vsix [-y] [--editor=<command>]
```

This command will:

- Ask which editor command to use (code/cursor/code-insiders) - defaults to 'code'
- Uninstall any existing version of the extension.
- Build the latest VSIX package.
- Install the newly built VSIX.
- Prompt you to restart VS Code for changes to take effect.

Options:

- `-y`: Skip all confirmation prompts and use defaults
- `--editor=<command>`: Specify the editor command (e.g., `--editor=cursor` or `--editor=code-insiders`)

### Manual VSIX Installation

If you prefer to install the VSIX package manually:

1.  First, build the VSIX package:
    ```sh
    pnpm vsix
    ```
2.  A `.vsix` file will be generated in the `bin/` directory (e.g., `bin/modelharbor-agent-<version>.vsix`).
3.  Install it manually using the VSCode CLI:
    ```sh
    code --install-extension bin/modelharbor-agent-<version>.vsix
    ```
